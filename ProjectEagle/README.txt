The servers the attacker the clients the thief.
It notifies the client if the computer mouse didnt move, scrolled or a key wasn't pressed for 5 seconds (you can change it).
Its used to know when people are not using the computer.
Used against people who use the mouse allot.

Edit: If you press in a task manager window it keeps printing "Didn't Move!" on & on, needs to be modified...
